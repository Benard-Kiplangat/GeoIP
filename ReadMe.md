# GeoIP Project to Detect Visitor's Country from IP
- Create a single reusable function(s) in JS/PHP/etc that can be added to any page.
- Must run locally, with no paid API keys or subscriptions
- Should be fast, running at less than 100 milliseconds lookup, with a rock-solid uptime

## Deliverables
- GeoIP scripts + installation notes
- Weekly auto-update for the free GeoIP DB (or header fallback)
